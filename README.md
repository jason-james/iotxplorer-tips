Using this, anyone can send IOTX to anyone on Twitter, even if they don’t have an IoTeX address. The bot (@iotxplorer_bot on Twitter) will register them an account, give them an IOTX address, send the tip, and let them know how to withdraw.

All tips are sent as individual transactions on the blockchain which increases the already strong IoTeX mainnet activity and utility of the IOTX token.

For more information on how to use the bot and all of its different functions, send a Twitter dm “!help” to @iotxplorer_bot.
